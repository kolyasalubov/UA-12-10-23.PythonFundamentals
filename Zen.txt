Zen of Python!!!
1.Beautiful is better than ugly.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
18.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
26.Readability counts.
30.Unless explicitly silenced
