#Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user.

#Write a function taking in a string like WOW this is REALLY          amazing 
# and returning Wow this is really amazing. 
# String should be capitalized and properly spaced. Using re and string is not allowed.

#You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:
#As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

# In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

#VII
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
#Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
#Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

#VIII
#You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

#Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

#IX 
#reate a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
#If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

#Some new animals have arrived at the zoo. The zoo keeper is concerned that perhaps the animals do not have the right tails. 
#To help her, you must correct the broken function to make sure that the second argument (tail), 
# is the same as the last letter of the first argument (body) - otherwise the tail wouldn't fit!
#If the tail is right return true, else return false.
